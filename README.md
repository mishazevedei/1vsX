-> Basic info:

Plugin Originally made by G0dFulL / misha.zevedei but rewrote by SSher1FF, helps with muteing dead people in a clutch situation
It uses sv_full_alltalk 0 so that the player who is trying to clutch can't hear anyone while the players alive from the other team can only hear them and not the dead.
Also it issues a HINT Message for everyone to see, announcing the mute on the dead.

-> Info About Me:

Im a new plugin author, of course the big help i got was from SSher1FF whom you can check out in the Links Section. Without him i wouldn't have understood making it even if he helped me only a bit in this case but more in other ones and im grateful to him.
